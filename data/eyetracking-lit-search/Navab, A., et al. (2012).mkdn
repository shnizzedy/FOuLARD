### Conclusion
Both ESCS (Early Social Communication Scales) and eye-tracking assessments can be used to assess RJA (Responsiveness to joint attention) in infants at risk for autism. However, neither the distal ESCS RJA task or eye-tracking assessments of RJA were correlated with language impairments at 18 months.'
